        <ul> Welcome to Linedancing for Beginners, here is where you'll embark on a journey to begin your linedancing era!! We will learn easy dances, listen to great music, and overall have fun!</ul>
    <p>Here are some things I like to tell beginners..</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First: If you ever catch yourself wanting to learn some new moves or dances, my best advice is to start with the basics and do it through youtube/watching others do it (literally how I learned).</li>
            <li>Secondly:Have dancefloor etiquette, meaning don't get into someone's space while on the floor. If you don't know the song and want to learn, practice on the side not in the middle where people are actively dancing. If you had too many, then don't attempt to make your way to the middle and distrupt others.</li>
            <li>Thirdly: Have fun!! Everyone starts somewhere so do not feel like you're not good enough because others are dancing more adanced and difficult dances</li>   
        </ul>
<h2>Below are common beginner linedances and their tutorials</h2>
   
<div class="dance">
<h3>Cupid Shuffle</h3>
    <p> The steps are within the lyric, for example; "Slide to the left, Slide to the right..." So all you have to do is listen to which direction it tells you to follow. Easy peasy!!! A 32 count, 4-wall, usually done to the song "Cupid Shuffle" by Cupid.</p>

<h3>Wagon Wheel</h3>
    <p> This is a 32 count, 4-wall beginners dance to Darius Rucker's cover of "Wagon Wheel" There are other variations, such as a more complex 64-count version called "Wagon Wheel Rock," but the 32-count version is the most common.</p>
