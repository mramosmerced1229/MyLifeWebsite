        <h3>Linedancing</h3>

        <p> First was introduced to country bars and linedancing back in 2020 whenever I was first attending Stetson University back at home in Fl, as a freshman in college. I fell in love with the entire atmosphere but did not really dwell deeper into it till after joining the navy and PCSing to WA where I ended finding my home bar Big Whiskey Saloon in Puyullup. I have been linedancing/swingdancing for roughly 3 years now and it has become an outlet one might say. Without linedancing, I wouldn't have the blessing to have met my beautiful and wonderful significant other Makensy (whom ofcourse was swooned by my amazing and wonderful dance moves). Without this, I genuinly do not believe I would have had made any positive and healthy outlets once getting out the Navy. Many overlook the transitioning process back to civilian life, especially a sober one, which is what I have been doing for the last two years now. But if I am completely honest what really, really, really brings me the most joy is whenever random individuals compliment my dancing and the radiating energy that they can physically see flow through each dance I do. My main objective whenever going out any free chance I have is to have fun and to share my positve aura to others!! Making nayone smile, even over the smallest of things, really can make a difference in someone's life.
        <p>Here are some things I like to tell beginners..</p>
        <ul>
        <li>First: If you ever catch yourself wanting to learn some new moves or dances, my best advice is to start with the basics and do it through youtube/watching others do it (literally how I learned).</li>
         <li>Secondly:Have dancefloor etiquette, meaning don't get into someone's space while on the floor. If you don't know the song and want to learn, practice on the side not in the middle where people are actively dancing. If you had too many, then don't attempt to make your way to the middle and distrupt others.</li>
         <li>Thirdly: Have fun!! Everyone starts somewhere so do not feel like you're not good enough because others are dancing more adanced and difficult dances</li>   
        </ul>

        <h3>Baseball</h3>
    <p>
        Whenever I was first adopted back in Texas, I was always an outgoing and athletic kid with my current and forever family! Once we moved to Fl, it did not take long for my parents to pick up the fact I was interested in baseball each time I'd pick up a ball or bat and showed early talent for it. The ironic part out of all this, as an outgoing and athletic kid, I did not like being dirty. My mom would mention each time I would slide or get clay/dirt on my pants, I would do whatever I could to wipe it off. Even if it meant staying on the bag and not moving to adance to the next bag. It did not take long for me to overcome that as I grew up. Even though my baseball career did not go further than my senior year of highschool, I still hold love for the sport that taught me many lessons that I still use till this day.
        
</p>
        <p>Here are some lessons I learned during my baseball career that I still use today in my life..</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Firstly: Never too small to do anything. Do not let anyone ever itimidate you becuase of difference in height.</li>
        <li> Secondly: When you get hit or roughed up, keep pushing forward and don't stay down.</li>
        <li> Thirdly: When you put your heart into something, the motivation to keep getting better in that aspect and exceed expectations will come naturally to you</li>
        <li> Fourthly: Things don't get handed to you on a silver platter, hardwork and determination get you places and rewards follow behind it</li>
        <li> Lastly: Never be afraid to ask questions or for help. The greatest attribute an individual can have is humbleness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Church</h3>
            <p> One thing about me is that I was raised in christian home and I am not afraid of my faith. I will never force my religion upon anyone and I am humble enough to admit that I lost my way once and that I am still working on myself everyday in growing my faith and living a life where God can work through me in various aspects. I do like to exclaim to my friends who don't walk on the same path as me or simply fell out out of church, that he placed not only me but all of us exactly where we are currently or in certain life altering situations, for a reason. Sometimes the hardest battles we face in life are based upon the fact he gives those hardships to his strongest soldiers to overcome, in order to come out stronger and wiser than before. There are many days where I must hold the assurance that my Lord and saviors purpose with me is quite beyond intentional and remebering his presence is always constant, even on the days I don't feel it.   
            </p>
        <p>Here are some lessons I learned while walking on this path..</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Firstly: Not to give up oneself when he hasn't given on me. He views me as treasure and not trash and his sacrifice for our sins proves that.</li>
        <li>Secondly: Sometimes we get hit by life and our primary response is to run and hide from the difficulty but that is indeed not the answer. We must remember that God's truth is greater that the pain we adhere. So we must step out of the dark and trust in the One whom values and cherishes us, even when we don't deserve it.</li>
        <li>Whatever you are going through right now does not mean it is the end of your story. This is not your final destination. It is simply an obstacle along the way. He is still writing your story and paving the path for you to follow, in order to reach the final and completed story destined for you.</li>
            </ul>
