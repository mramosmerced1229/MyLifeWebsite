    <p>Whenever I was first adopted back in Texas, I was always an outgoing and athletic kid with my current and forever family! Once we moved to Fl, it did not take long for my parents to pick up the fact I was interested in baseball each time I'd pick up a ball or bat and showed early talent for it. The ironic part out of all this, as an outgoing and athletic kid, I did not like being dirty. My mom would mention each time I would slide or get clay/dirt on my pants, I would do whatever I could to wipe it off. Even if it meant staying on the bag and not moving to adance to the next bag. It did not take long for me to overcome that as I grew up. Even though my baseball career did not go further than my senior year of highschool, I still hold love for the sport that taught me many lessons that I still use till this day. 
</p>
    <p>Here are some lessons I learned during my baseball career that I still use today in my life..</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li> Firstly: Never too small to do anything. Do not let anyone ever itimidate you because of differences in height.</li>
            <li> Secondly: When you get hit or roughed up, keep pushing forward and don't stay down.</li>
            <li> Thirdly: When you put your heart into something, the motivation to keep getting better in that aspect and exceed expectations will come naturally to you</li>
            <li> Fourthly: Things don't get handed to you on a silver platter, hardwork and determination get you places and rewards follow behind it</li>
            <li> Lastly: Never be afraid to ask questions or for help. The greatest attribute an individual can have is humbleness.</li>
        </ul>
