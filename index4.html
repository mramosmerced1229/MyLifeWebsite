    <p> One thing about me is that I was raised in a christian home and I am not afraid of my faith. I will never force my religion upon anyone and I am humble enough to admit that I lost my way once and that I am still working on myself everyday in growing my faith and living a life where God can work through me in various aspects. I do like to exclaim to my friends who don't walk on the same path as me or simply fell out out of church, that he placed not only me but all of us exactly where we are currently or in certain life altering situations, for a reason. Sometimes the hardest battles we face in life are based upon the fact he gives those hardships to his strongest soldiers to overcome, in order to come out stronger and wiser than before. There are many days where I must hold the assurance that my Lord and saviors purpose with me is quite beyond intentional and remebering his presence is always constant, even on the days I don't feel it.   
</p>
  <p>Here are some lessons I learned while walking on this path..</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly: Not to give up on oneself when he hasn't given on me. He views me as treasure and not trash and his sacrifice for our sins proves that.</li>
                <li>Secondly: Sometimes we get hit by life and our primary response is to run and hide from the difficulty but that is indeed not the answer. We must remember that God's truth is greater than that of the pain we adhere. So we must step out of the dark and trust in the Lord whom values and cherishes us, even when we don't deserve it.</li>
                <li>Whatever you are going through right now does not mean it is the end of your story. This is not your final destination. It is simply an obstacle along the way. He is still writing your story and paving the path for you to follow, in order to reach the final and completed story destined for you.</li>
            </ul>
